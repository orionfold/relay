# Resurface primitives (wave 1)

## Description

A pack is only as expressive as the primitive kinds it can declare. The catalog needs richer
analytics — matrix views, budget breakdowns, trend overlays, and N-panel dashboards. The
visualization audit (`packs-evolution.md §6`) is decisive:
for wave 1, **the gap is wiring and declarability, not charting.** Several rich capabilities
already exist in the codebase but are un-declarable from a manifest, buried behind non-default
tabs, or wired to nothing.

This feature resurfaces the three cheapest, highest-leverage capabilities — it lifts *every
existing pack* without building any new chart component:

1. **Table charts exist but are un-declarable and buried.** Recharts bar/line/pie/scatter
   render behind a non-default "Charts" tab, three clicks deep
   (`src/components/tables/table-detail-tabs.tsx`), and **no manifest can pre-declare one**.
2. **A fully-built, tested `RunCadenceHeatmap` is wired to nothing**
   (`src/components/charts/run-cadence-heatmap.tsx`); the coach view kit even carries
   `coachCadenceCells` data it never renders.
3. **`KpiTile` has `trend`/`spark` fields that `evaluateKpi` never populates**
   (`src/lib/apps/view-kits/evaluate-kpi.ts`) — every manifest KPI renders as a dead flat scalar.

Wave 1 is P1: it is cheap, unblocks the depth packs' visual needs that *already have a
component*, and is a prerequisite for `pack-depth-next-wave` deciding what genuinely needs a
*new* primitive (§6 build-vs-resurface rule).

## User Story

As a pack author, I want to declare a chart, a run-cadence heatmap, and a KPI trend sparkline
directly in my app manifest, so that a pack ships with its analytics visible by default instead
of hidden behind tabs or silently un-rendered.

## Technical Approach

Each item follows the §6 rule "capability EXISTS, just un-declarable or buried → **resurface**":

- **Declarable + auto-materialized table charts.** Add a manifest-declarable chart binding
  (new Zod arm on the view/table schema in `src/lib/apps/registry.ts`, staying `.strict()`)
  that a pack can pre-declare, and auto-materialize a sensible default chart so the "Charts"
  tab is not the only entry point. Keep the existing tab; add a manifest path + a promoted
  default surface. No new chart component — reuse the existing recharts library.
- **Wire `RunCadenceHeatmap` to a view kit.** Bind the orphaned, tested heatmap to the coach
  kit's already-present `coachCadenceCells` data, and expose it as a manifest-declarable kit
  slot. This is pure wiring — the component and its tests already exist.
- **Feed `trend`/`spark` into `evaluateKpi`.** Populate the existing `KpiTile.trend`/`spark`
  fields from the KPI source's windowed history (the same windowing `tableSumWindowed`
  already computes for ledger KPIs), so manifest KPIs render as trend tiles instead of flat
  scalars. No new KPI-source kind — extend the evaluator to emit the fields the tile already
  accepts.
- **Manifest ceiling stays the discipline.** Every new declarable arm is a deliberate Core
  primitive with a Zod arm + evaluator/kit wiring — never a manifest escape hatch, never a
  component ref or formula string (`registry.ts` `.strict()` contract preserved).

**Smoke budget (CLAUDE.md):** the view-kit evaluator and manifest schema are reachable from
the runtime registry — budget an end-to-end `npm run dev` smoke that installs a pack declaring
each resurfaced primitive and renders it, not just unit tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A pack manifest can declare a table chart; the chart renders on a default/promoted
      surface (not only three clicks deep behind the "Charts" tab). **DELIVERED** via
      `ChartSpecSchema` (`.strict()`) + `view.bindings.charts`, loaded by `loadChartData`
      (`data.ts`) and rendered as promoted Tracker `secondary` slots (`TableChartView`).
      **DEFER (Half B):** "an undeclared table still auto-materializes a sensible default chart"
      in the buried Charts tab is deferred (operator-confirmed 2026-07-05) — separate concern,
      touches the existing tab UX with regression risk, lower leverage than the manifest path.
      **Trigger to un-defer:** the first pack that ships a data table with no declared chart AND
      a field report that its Charts tab reads empty/confusing → auto-pick a default chart in the
      tab empty-state (first categorical x + first numeric y).
- [x] `RunCadenceHeatmap` renders from a view-kit slot fed by `coachCadenceCells`; the
      previously-orphaned component is no longer wired to nothing. **DELIVERED** — Coach kit
      `buildModel` renders it in a "Run cadence" secondary slot (always-on when the coach kit is
      selected, matching the ledger hero-chart precedent).
- [x] `evaluateKpi` populates `trend` and `spark` for KPI sources with windowed history; a
      manifest KPI renders as a trend tile with a sparkline instead of a flat scalar.
      **DELIVERED** — `tableSumWindowedSeries` added to `KpiContext`; `tableSumWindowed` (with a
      window) fills `trend`/`spark`; every other kind stays a flat scalar.
- [x] The manifest schema stays `.strict()` — no component refs, no formula strings; each new
      capability is a typed Zod arm with an evaluator/kit binding. **DELIVERED** —
      `ChartSpecSchema` is `.strict()` and enumerated; rejects an unknown `type` and a
      `component:` escape-hatch field (view-schema tests).
- [x] An end-to-end dev-server smoke installs a pack exercising all three resurfaced primitives
      and renders them correctly (per the runtime-registry smoke budget). **DELIVERED** — isolated
      Tracker and Coach installs of the synthetic bundled Agency fixture rendered the promoted chart,
      labeled KPI sparklines, and the 84-cell cadence heatmap under real `npm run dev` instances.
- [x] Every existing pack still installs and renders; no regression to current view kits.
      **DELIVERED** — full `src/lib/apps` + charts + tables suites green (397).

## Scope Boundaries

**Included:**
- Making table charts manifest-declarable + promoting them onto a kit surface (Tracker
  `secondary` slots), off the buried tab.
- Wiring the existing `RunCadenceHeatmap` to a kit slot.
- Populating existing `trend`/`spark` KPI-tile fields from windowed history.

**Deferred (not dropped — see the AC trigger):**
- Auto-materializing a sensible default chart for an *undeclared* table inside the existing
  Charts tab. Lower leverage + UX-regression risk on the current tab; the manifest path is the
  real resurfacing win.

**Excluded:**
- **Building any genuinely-new primitive** — value-heatmap/matrix, radar/spider,
  multi-series/overlay trends, N-panel dashboard grid. Those are ABSENT under the fixed slots
  and are `pack-depth-next-wave`'s "build only when a selected pack needs it" scope (§6).
- Exposing the cost/monitor dashboard widgets to kits (deferred; lower leverage this wave).
- Any pack content changes — this is engine-side resurfacing shared by all packs.

## Verification run — 2026-07-12

- Installed two isolated local copies of the bundled synthetic Relay Agency pack through the real
  `relay pack add <path>` CLI path: Tracker mode declared the table chart and windowed KPIs; Coach
  mode exercised the cadence slot. Each install created 4 tables, seeded 35 rows and 6 customers,
  and installed 7 profiles plus 7 blueprints.
- The first real render exposed a timestamp-unit defect: Drizzle persists SQLite `timestamp` values
  as epoch seconds, but `tableSumWindowedSeries` divided them by 1000 before daily bucketing. That
  collapsed all history into 1970 and silently suppressed trends. The query now buckets stored epoch
  seconds directly, with a regression test proving two persisted days remain two series points.
- Added a concrete initial dimension to Recharts' `ResponsiveContainer`, while retaining responsive
  width/height, so the promoted chart no longer logs a `-1` server/hydration size warning.
- Fresh browser evidence: Tracker rendered `Engagements by category` as a live Recharts surface plus
  accessible `Billed (MTD) trend` and `Costs (MTD) trend` sparklines; Coach rendered `Run cadence`
  with all 84 heatmap cells. Both fresh tabs had zero browser warnings/errors, and both server runs
  loaded without module-registry errors.
- Final checks: 136 focused tests passed across schema, evaluator, data context, Tracker/Coach kits,
  heatmap, integration, and pack-install coverage; `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed.
